# Ambush Mission 


The idea of this ctf is foud the flag that is hidden in the img (https://mega.nz/#!TKZ3DabY!BEUHD7VJvq_b-M22eD4VfHv_PPBnW2m7CZUfMbveZYw).

# How to solve



The idea of the challenge is analyzed images in different planes by taking off bits of the image, in fact of that, I use Stegsolve(in case that you don't have the tool in your computer, you can install it from this GitHub

In the bottom, you will find arrows, those change the filter in the image, then you will find the flag!!, nah just kidding.

When you change the filter with the tool, you will find a reverse code (==QTh9lMx8Fd08VZt9FdFNTb), i notice that the code is reversed because, the "=="  always go to the end of the code, then After we have arranged the code, we have to change it to BASE64, and it will give us the flag =  ' m3Et_me_4t_12_aM'
